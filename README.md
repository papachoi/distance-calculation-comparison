# Distance Calculation Comparison

This repository contains a Python script for comparing the calculation times of distances between atoms in a box using different methods:
1. Without a cutoff radius and without parallel processing.
2. Without a cutoff radius and with parallel processing.
3. With a cutoff radius and without parallel processing.
4. With a cutoff radius and with parallel processing (using 4 cores).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
